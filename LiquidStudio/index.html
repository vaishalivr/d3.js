	<h2 class='mainheading'>Change in Communication Services Landscape Over the Years</h2>
	<p class="subheading">This is how United States is Graduating when speaking about Communications</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<!-- <br>
	<br> -->

	<p class="introduction">The way we communicate and the way the communication services are provided has changed over time and is expected to keep evolving in the future. Below is an attempt to determine change in customer behaviour and companyâ€™s response over time.</p>

	<p class="introduction">The interactive visualization (made in D3.js) comes as an answer to a series of questions which have been formulated keeping the reader in mind and comparing to others in United States. And a showcase of what have the service providers done to make this possible.</p>

	<p class="introduction">The data has been collected from a number of sources but mostly <a href="https://www.statista.com/">Statista</a> (not behind paywall) and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/">Pew Research</a>. Simple linear regression has helped determine the missing values in a data row.
	Number of televisions, broadband connection are calculated as a function of number of households in the US, while cellphones, smart phone only internet users has been calculated as a function on population of the United States.</p>

	<div>Other aspects of these changes are:</div>
	<br>
	<div> - Increase in usage of smart devices such as smartphones, smart TVs, IoT based devices like voice assistants, digital wearables, home automation,etc.</div>

	<div>Other coping mechanisms are:</div>
	<br>
	<div> - Constant innovation to provide higher band width (mostly getting driven by increase in usage of video streaming services) by increase in investment of technology like Hybrid fiber cable(HFC), fiber to the home(FTTH), all this in addition to providing good content and user experience.</div>
	<br>
	<div> - Reliable service while reducing operational costs by investing in IoT to monitor in real time, to fix equipment issues and to make adjustments to remote equipments.</div>
